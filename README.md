# Raspberry Pi Poweroff Script #

Small script to poweroff Raspberry Pi at the push of a button on pin 5. Pushing the button again will cause a restart from the halt state, so this will function as a power on/off button. It won't truly cut the power, but a Pi in the halt state draws very little current.
